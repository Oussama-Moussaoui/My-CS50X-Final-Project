# My CS50X (2020) Final Project
In this repository I'll be sharing my final project for CS50 (2020) course (If you are a current CS50 student, I hope this would be an inspiration). It's a simple web app for writing notes. The app works fine, but still have some tiny bugs in it... You can download the code, run it, play with the app a bit, and try to make it better.


# MORE DETAILS
My final project is a web application that I developed using python (flask), SQL database, and Bootstrap.

The project's title is "CS50 NOTES", as it allows users, after they log in to the website, to access their private notes.

This web application has many features such as writing whatever comes to the user's mind in a text format, and no one else could see their notes. Also, they can edit or delete their notes whenever they feel like doing it. And lastly, every note comes with the exact date and time they wrote it down.

# CREDIT
The CSS in this project I did not do it on my own. Most of it was copied from "CS50 finance" (https://finance.cs50.net/). Because I wanted to implement the same style to my project..
