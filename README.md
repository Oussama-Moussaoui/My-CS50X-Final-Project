# My-CS50X-Final-Project
In this repository I'll be sharing my final project for CS50 course (If you are a current student, I hope this would be an inspiration). It's a simple web app for writing notes. The app works fine, but still have some tiny bugs in it... You can download the code, run it, play with the app a bit, and try to make it better.
